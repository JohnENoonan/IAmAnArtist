# I Am An Artist
A code poem about creation

## About
The poem consists of a processing sketch along with a JSON file. The main program is [imAnArtist.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/imAnArtist.pde) with classes in [artist.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/artist.pde), and [idea.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/idea.pde) with text inside [thoughts.json](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/mind/thoughts.json). This piece was created to comment on the nature of artistic creation and how successful art work is often unoriginal and dependent on the audience's previous experiences with art. Over time the words and creations of the artist fight for space in the public view and create a cacophony of noise and static that ends with no meaning being ascertained.

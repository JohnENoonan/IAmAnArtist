# I Am An Artist
A code poem about creation

## About
The poem consists of a processing sketch along with a JSON file. The main program is [imAnArtist.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/imAnArtist.pde) with classes in [artist.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/artist.pde), and [idea.pde](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/idea.pde) with text inside [thoughts.json](https://github.com/JohnENoonan/IAmAnArtist/blob/master/mind/thoughts.json). This piece was created to comment on the nature of artistic creation, sharing on the internet, and the idea of the "lone genius" and the value of art.
